            <p style="font-size: large;">Treaty 1 was signed in 1871 between the Canadian government and several First Nations.
                It was negotiated at lower Fort-Garry in Manitoba, Canada.
                The first seven nations that are involved in in treaty 1 are Peguis First nation, Sagkeeng first nation, long plain first nation, Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation and Swan Lake First Nation. 
                Treaty 1, signed in 1871, promised the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree of southern Manitoba land, schools, and annual payments. 
                The government promised each band 160 acres per family of five, or depending on the family's size.
                The government promised an annual annuity of $3 per person, or $15 per family of five. fgfdgerger </p>
