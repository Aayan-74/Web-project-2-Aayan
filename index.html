            <h1>What are Treaties?</h1>
            <h3>Before we dive in and take a look at what Treaty 1 is and the promises and agreements made in Treaty 1 Manitoba let's review what Treaties are and their purpose:</h3>
            <p>A treaty is an officially recognized agreement or arrangement, typically between nations or other international parties, which outlines specific rights, responsibilities, or actions to be taken.
                It serves as a framework to establish mutual understanding and cooperation on issues like diplomacy, trade, security, or environmental matters.
                Once agreed upon, it often requires formal ratification by the involved parties and is governed by international law.</p>
            <h1>Understanding Treaty 1</h1>
            <!--paragraph tag is used to display content and the style attribute in the paragraph tag is being used to make the font-size bigger-->
            <p style="font-size: large;">Treaty 1 was signed in 1871 between the Canadian government and several First Nations.
                It was negotiated at lower Fort-Garry in Manitoba, Canada.
                The first seven nations that are involved in in treaty 1 are Peguis First nation, Sagkeeng first nation, long plain first nation, Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation and Swan Lake First Nation. 
                Treaty 1, signed in 1871, promised the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree of southern Manitoba land, schools, and annual payments. 
                The government promised each band 160 acres per family of five, or depending on the family's size, they also promised an annual annuity of $3 per person, or $15 per family of five.
                Additional commitments, known as "outside promises," were made but not initially included in the written treaty.
                These included providing chiefs with distinctive clothing, buggies, and farming supplies such as plows, oxen, and cows. 
                These promises were formally recognized and integrated into the treaty in 1875.
                through ongoing efforts to honor its promises, including recognizing Indigenous rights, engaging in meaningful consultations, and working towards reconciliation through initiatives like the Treaty One Nation's self-determination efforts and land reclamation.
                Unlike later treaties (e.g., Treaty 5 and Treaty 10), Treaty 1 did not explicitly outline hunting and fishing rights.
                In contrast, later treaties included stronger guarantees for hunting, fishing, and trapping, allowing Indigenous communities to continue traditional livelihoods.
                Treaty 1 was a foundational agreement but was less comprehensive than later treaties. The challenges and disputes that arose from it (such as the "outside promises" issue) influenced how future treaties were structured to be clearer and more beneficial for Indigenous peoples.
                Its impact continues today, particularly in urban reserve development and economic initiatives.</p>
