            <h3>Before we dive in and take a look at what Treaty 1 is and the promises and agreements made in Treaty 1 Manitoba let's review what Treaties are and their purpose:</h3>
            <p>A treaty is a formal agreement between countries or international groups.
                It sets out specific rules, responsibilities, or actions they agree to follow.
                We use treaties because, treaties help create understanding and cooperation on things like trade, security, the environment, or diplomacy.
                Once everyone agrees to it, the treaty usually needs to be officially approved by the countries involved and is guided by international law.

                <h1>Understanding Treaty 1</h1>
            <!--Paragraph tag used to display content-->
            <p>Treaty 1 was signed in 1871 between the Canadian government and several First Nations.
                It was negotiated at lower Fort-Garry in Manitoba, Canada.
                The first seven nations that are involved in in treaty 1 are Peguis First nation, Sagkeeng first nation, long plain first nation, Roseau River Anishinaabe First Nation, Sandy Bay Ojibway First Nation and Swan Lake First Nation. 
                Treaty 1, signed in 1871, promised the Anishinabek and Swampy Cree of southern Manitoba land, schools, and annual payments. 
                The government promised each band 160 acres per family of five, or depending on the family's size, they also promised an annual annuity of $3 per person, or $15 per family of five.
                
                <!--Heading level 1-->
                <h1>Additional commitments of Treaty 1</h1>
                <!--Paragraph tag used to display content-->
                <p>Additional commitments, known as "outside promises," were made but not initially included in the written treaty.
                These included providing chiefs with distinctive clothing, buggies, and farming supplies such as plows, oxen, and cows. 
                These promises were formally recognized and integrated into the treaty in 1875.
                through ongoing efforts to honor its promises, including recognizing Indigenous rights, engaging in meaningful consultations, and working towards reconciliation through initiatives like the Treaty One Nation's self-determination efforts and land reclamation.
                Unlike later treaties (e.g., Treaty 5 and Treaty 10), Treaty 1 did not explicitly outline hunting and fishing rights.
                In contrast, later treaties included stronger guarantees for hunting, fishing, and trapping, allowing Indigenous communities to continue traditional livelihoods.
                Treaty 1 was a foundational agreement but was less comprehensive than later treaties. The challenges and disputes that arose from it (such as the "outside promises" issue) influenced how future treaties were structured to be clearer and more beneficial for Indigenous peoples.
                Its impact continues today, particularly in urban reserve development and economic initiatives.</p>
